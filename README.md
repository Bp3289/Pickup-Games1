The app uses ionic, angularjs, and firebase.

I choose ionic because the app will be used on mobile devices. Ionic is a helpful, easy setup for mobile applications.

Angularjs works nicely with Ionic because of the sliding windows that allows for an easy setup.

Firebase is the backend database that is used for this project. Firebase controls all authentication and data binding for this app.

The approach I took was to make this app simple and user friendly. People that will use this app just want to find events fast. With that in mind I tried to keep the app very simple, that's why there is only two pages in the app.

Also the markers on google maps needed to be colorful to signify the different sport events in the area. Also wanted the user to be able to confirm attending, so inside each info marker there is a checkbox to confirm.
